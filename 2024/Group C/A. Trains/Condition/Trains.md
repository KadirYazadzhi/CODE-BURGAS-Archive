# Trains

## Description
Two trains depart simultaneously from two different stations and travel towards each other. The first train travels at a speed of $v_1$ km/h, and the second train at a speed of $v_2$ km/h. The distance between the two stations is $d$ km.

Write a program that calculates the following:
1.  How much time in hours will it take for the trains to meet?
2.  What will be the total distance traveled by both trains until the moment of meeting?

## Input
*   Speed of the first train $v_1$ (in km/h)
*   Speed of the second train $v_2$ (in km/h)
*   Distance between the two stations $d$ (in km)

## Output
*   The meeting time of the trains in hours;
*   The total distance traveled by both trains in km.

This problem can be solved using the physics formula for time, which is equal to distance divided by speed. The total distance traveled by both trains is the sum of the distances traveled by each train, which is equal to the product of time and speed of each train.

## Example

### Input
```
100
150
300
```

### Output
```
1
250
```
