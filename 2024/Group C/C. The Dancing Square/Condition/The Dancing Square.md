# The Dancing Square

## Description
Imagine you are a programmer working on a new computer game. In the game, there is a character that is a square, and it can move around the screen. Your task is to write a program that models the movement of the square. The square should be able to move up, down, left, and right on the screen. Here are some details about the task: The square has a side of length $a$ and its center is at coordinates $x$ and $y$. When the square moves, the coordinates of its center change. Your program should input the initial coordinates of the square and the length of its side. Then, the program should calculate and output the new coordinates of the square after a certain number of movements along the $x$ and $y$ axes.

## Input
The first line of the input contains three integers $x, y$ and $a$ – the coordinates of the center and the side length of the square.
The next line contains two integers $dx$ and $dy$ – the specified number of movements that the square must make along the $x$ and $y$ axes.

## Output
Output three integers $x, y$ and $a$ – the new coordinates of the center and the side length of the square.

## Example

### Input
```
10 0 10
-5 5
```

### Output
```
5 5 10
```
