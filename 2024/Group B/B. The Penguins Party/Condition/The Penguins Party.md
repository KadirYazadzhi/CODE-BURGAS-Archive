# The Penguins Party

## Description
Penguins love to play games and decided to organize a big party. Each penguin arrives at the party with a certain number of fish they have caught. Penguins are very big fans of competitions and decided to have one: the penguin who manages to collect the largest sum of fish from their neighbors will be crowned "King of the Party".

Your task is to write a program that helps the penguins determine which of them will be "King of the Party". You need to find the maximum sum that can be obtained from a sequence of numbers where no number is adjacent to another.

## Input
The first line will contain a single integer $N$ ($1 \le N \le 10^5$) - the number of penguins at the party.
The second line will contain $N$ integers, separated by a space - the number of fish each penguin has brought.

## Output
Output a single number - the maximum sum of fish that can be collected from the penguins.

## Example

### Input
```
8
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
