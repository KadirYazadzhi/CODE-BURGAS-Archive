# Egyptian Fractions

## Description
Egyptian fractions are represented by two integers: a numerator and a denominator, where the numerator is always one, and the denominator starts from the number 2 and increases. Here is a list of the first four Egyptian fractions: 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, .... If a rational number is given, represented by two integers, for the numerator and denominator respectively, write a program that breaks down this number as a sum of Egyptian fractions.

## Input
On a single line of the standard input, two integers are given representing the numerator and denominator of the rational number.

## Output
On a single line of the standard output, output the list of Egyptian fractions separated by a space, whose sum is equal to the input rational number.

## Example

### Input
```
7 9
```

### Output
```
1/2 1/4 1/36
