# Candies

## Description
Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Anna who loved to collect different kinds of candies. One day she went to a candy store where she saw a large jar full of candies of different colors and sizes. The shopkeeper told her that she could choose as many candies as she wanted, but she had to follow one rule: for every candy she chose, instead of its value, she had to pay its weight in grams.

Anna was excited by the challenge and began to think about how she could get the most candies for her money. She quickly realized that if she chose the largest candies first, she would end up paying more for each candy and wouldn't be able to get as many. Instead, she decided to use a greedy algorithm to maximize the amount of candies she could get for her money.

Anna's greedy algorithm worked as follows: she first sorted the candies by their weight in descending order. Then she started choosing the candies one by one, starting with the heaviest, until she could not afford any more candies.

Using this algorithm, Anna managed to get a lot of candies for her money. She managed to choose the candies that gave her the most value for her money, without wasting her money on smaller, less valuable candies. Anna was very happy with the successful use of the greedy algorithm and enjoyed her day filled with candies!

## Input
From the first line of the standard input, two integers are entered: $B$ and $N$, which correspond to Anna's budget and the number of candies in the jar, separated by a single space.
On the next $N$ lines, two integers are entered, corresponding to the weight in grams and the value of each candy, separated by a single space.

## Output
On a single line of the standard output, the program should output the total value of candies Anna managed to buy and her remaining budget.
