# Journey

## Description
Once upon a time, there was a young man named Dimitar who lived in a small village surrounded by hills and mountains. He always wanted to explore the world beyond the mountains and dreamed of traveling to distant places. One day, he decided to go on a journey to the nearest city to fulfill his dream.

However, the journey was not going to be easy. The path to the city was full of hills, valleys, and streams. Dimitar had to cross many obstacles and make his way through winding paths to reach his goal. He asked the villagers for directions, and they gave him a map showing the way to the city.

But Dimitar was not satisfied with just the map. He wanted to know the exact distance he had to travel to reach the city.

Help Dimitar by writing a program that can find the shortest path between two points on the map.

## Input
On the first line of the standard input, three integers are entered: $V, S, T$, which correspond to the number of points on the map, the starting point, and the ending point of the journey, separated by a single space.
The following lines of the standard input also contain three integers: $U, V, W$, which correspond to a route from point $U$ to $V$ with length $W$.

## Output
On the standard output, the program must find and print the shortest path from point $S$ to point $T$ on the map.

## Example

### Input
```
6 0 5
0 1 5
0 2 1
1 2 2
1 3 4
2 3 1
2 4 7
