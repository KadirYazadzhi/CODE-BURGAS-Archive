# Sphere

## Description
In a small village nestled among the hills lived a curious young girl named Sophia. She loved to explore the world around her, always asking questions and seeking answers to satisfy her thirst for knowledge. One day, while wandering through the forest, she stumbled upon a mysterious object. A small sphere, perfectly smooth and round, with a cold surface that felt like polished marble.

Sophia was fascinated by the sphere and spent the rest of the day examining it from every angle. As she turned it in her hands, she wondered how to measure its size. She knew that the sphere had a center and a certain radius, but she didn't know how to find its volume and surface area.

Determined to solve this mystery, Sophia decided to consult the wisest old man who had lived in the village all his life and had a wealth of knowledge about the world. She turned to him for help in solving the problem. The old man listened to Sophia's question and smiled. He explained to her that the formula for the volume of a sphere is $V = (4/3) \times \pi \times r^3$, where $r$ is the radius of the sphere, and $\pi$ is a mathematical constant, and the formula for the surface area of a sphere is $A = 4 \times \pi \times r^2$.

Sophia was amazed by the old man's knowledge and thanked him for his help. She returned to the sphere, measured the radius, and used the formulas to calculate its volume and surface area. As she worked through the equations, she felt a sense of satisfaction that came from solving the problem.

From that day on, Sophia continued to explore the world around her, always eager to learn more about the mysteries of the Universe. And whenever she encountered a new problem, she remembered the lesson she learned from the wise old man and used her knowledge to find the answers she sought.

Write a program that, given the radius of the sphere, finds its volume and surface area.

## Input
From the standard input, a floating-point number is entered, corresponding to the radius of the sphere.

## Output
On a single line of the standard output, the program should output the volume and surface area of the sphere, separated by a space.

## Example

### Input

```
4.0
```

### Output

```
268.083 201.062
```
