# Explanation: Apples

## Problem Analysis
Hristo has $M$ apples and wants to divide them equally between himself and his $N$ friends. We need to find how many apples each person gets.

## Algorithmic Approach
1.  **Calculate Total People**: The total number of people is $N + 1$ (Hristo + his friends).
2.  **Integer Division**: Each person receives `M / (N + 1)` apples.
3.  **Result**: Output the result of the division.

## Complexity
*   **Time Complexity**: O(1).
*   **Space Complexity**: O(1).

## Key Insights
*   The problem asks to divide apples "equally", which in integer arithmetic means finding the quotient of the division.
