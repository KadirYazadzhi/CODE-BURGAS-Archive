# Apples

## Description
Once upon a time, there was a young boy named Hristo who loved arithmetic. He was always eager to solve problems and loved the feeling of accomplishment he got when he found the right answer.

One day Hristo received a challenging arithmetic problem to solve from his teacher.
The problem was: "If Hristo has 15 apples and wants to share them equally between himself and his two friends, how many apples will each person get?"

Help Hristo by writing a program that divides the apples equally.
