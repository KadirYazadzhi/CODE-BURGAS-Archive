## 🚀 Getting Started

This project uses **CMake** to manage builds, allowing you to compile and run any individual solution easily.

### Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) (version 3.10 or higher)

### Building with CLion (Recommended)
1. Open the repository root folder in **CLion**.
2. Wait for the CMake project to load.
3. Select any specific problem target (e.g., `2025_Group_A_A__The_Prince_And_The_Palindromes...`) from the run configurations dropdown.
4. Run or Debug the solution directly.

### Building from Command Line
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --target <target_name>
./<target_name>
```
