# Friendly Numbers

## Description
Given two integers $A$ and $B$. We call them friendly if the sum of the divisors of $A$ (excluding $A$ itself) is equal to $B$, and the sum of the divisors of $B$ (excluding $B$ itself) is equal to $A$. Write a computer program that checks whether two integers are friendly.

## Input
