# Dragons And Lamias

## Description
Once upon a time, in a distant kingdom, dragons and lamias lived in a wonderful array of numbers. Dragons loved to gather in large cohesive groups, while lamias preferred to scatter in separate places. One day, the King of Programmers announced a great challenge: to find the longest sequence of dragons or lamias that stood next to each other, without interruption. A young programmer joined this challenge, who had to write a magical program. It would traverse the array and count the length of the longest group of identical dragons or lamias, revealing which of them were most strongly connected in their kingdom. The programmer began his work, armed with courage and logic, ready to solve the riddle. And how will this story end? That depends on your programming skills!
