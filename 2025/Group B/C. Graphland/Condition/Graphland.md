# Graphland

## Description
Once upon a time, in a distant land, there was a magical kingdom woven from paths and crossroads, called Graphland. This kingdom was built from $N$ radiant vertices, connected by $M$ paths, along which messages, gold, secrets, and dreams were transported. The Count of Graphland, an old and wise ruler, posed a riddle to his subjects: "Oh, inhabitants of Graphland," he spoke, "the discovery of the shortest path from the mighty Tower A to the majestic Palace B is vital. Which of you will manage to trace the path through our intricate and directed highways? Remember, time is of the essence!" The subjects of Graphland set to work, armed with mathematical precision and algorithmic magic. Help Graphland by writing a computer program that solves the task.
