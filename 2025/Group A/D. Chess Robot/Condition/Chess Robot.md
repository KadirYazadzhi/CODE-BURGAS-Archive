# Chess Robot

## Description
In a kingdom full of magical chessboards, lived a small but brave robot. The robot loved adventures and often embarked on journeys across the chessboard, always starting from cell (1, 1). One day, he received an exciting mission - to reach the magical cell ($x, y$). But the path was difficult, as the robot could only move in a special way, similar to a knight's move in chess. Your task as a great navigator is to help the robot find the shortest path to the magical cell. Write a spell (program) that will calculate the minimum number of moves required for the robot to reach its goal. Will you be able to successfully guide the robot through the challenging terrain?

## Input
On the first line of the standard input, two integers are entered, corresponding to the coordinates $x$ and $y$ ($1 \le x, y \le 8$).

## Output
On a single line of the standard output, output an integer corresponding to the minimum number of moves of the robot.
