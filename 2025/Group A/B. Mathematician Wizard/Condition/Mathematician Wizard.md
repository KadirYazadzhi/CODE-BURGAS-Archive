# Mathematician Wizard

## Description
Once upon a time, there was an old and wise number that lived in the kingdom of Prime Numbers. This number, called $N$, wanted to know if it could be formed from two magical numbers that lived in the same kingdom. The magical numbers were known as Prime Numbers and had an exceptional ability – they were divisible only by themselves and by one.

Your challenge as a mathematical wizard is to check if the number $N$ can be represented as the sum of two different Prime numbers. If this is possible, you will bring joy to the kingdom, and if not – the number $N$ will continue to search for its secret.

## Input
On a single line of the standard input, an integer $N$ is entered ($1 \le N \le 10^6$).

## Output
On a single line of the standard output, output `YES` if $N$ can be represented as a sum of prime numbers, and `NO` otherwise.

## Example

### Input
```

37
```

### Output
