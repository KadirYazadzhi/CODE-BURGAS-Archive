# The Prince And The Palindromes

## Description
In a distant kingdom, there lived a sad prince named Nits. He was handsome, but his heart was full of confused letters that could not be reflected symmetrically in each other. The prince longed to become a true palindrome - perfect, mirrored, and flawless. But to achieve this, he needed help. Your challenge as a wizard of numbers and symbols is to help Prince Nits. Write a spell (program) that counts how many magical replacements you need to make to transform Nits into a palindrome. The path may be difficult, but the prince believes in you!
