# Arrayland

## Description
In a distant kingdom called Arrayland, lived a group of numbers that were part of a magical array. They dreamed of finding the longest subgroup among them that could create a special magical sum $S$. The wise King Sumagius announced that only the longest subgroup, consisting of numbers that together yield a value exactly equal to $S$, would receive a prize – eternal recognition and joy. Your challenge is to help the numbers of Arrayland find this special group. Write a spell (program) that will find the length of the longest subarray that yields the magical sum $S$. The kingdom relies on your help to find harmony!

## Input
On the first line of the standard input, two integers are entered, corresponding to the number of elements in the array and the value of the sought sum.
On the second line, a list of integers separated by a space is entered.

## Output
On a single line of the standard output, output an integer corresponding to the length of the longest subarray.
