# Difference

## Description
When Stanislava gave birth to her son Martin, she was exactly 20 years old. On his first and second birthdays, she noticed that his age divided hers without a remainder (21 and 1; 22 and 2) and decided to check how many times this would happen in the next 20 years.

Write a program that, given the mother's age $A$ at birth, determines how many times the child's age will divide her age without a remainder over the next $Y$ years.

## Input

## Output
Output on a single line the mother's ages during which the child's age divides hers without a remainder.

## Example

### Input
```
20 20
```

### Output
```
21 22 24 25 30 40
```
