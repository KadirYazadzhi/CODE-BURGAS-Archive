# Sequence

## Description
A sequence of $N$ distinct positive integers is given. Find a subsequence formed by the smallest $M$ numbers in the sequence ($M < N$), preserving their relative order. If one element of the given sequence is before another element (has a smaller index), it must also be before it in the resulting subsequence.

## Input
From the standard input, on the first line, $N$ and $M$ are entered.
On the second line, $N$ numbers of the given sequence are entered.

## Output
Output the resulting subsequence of $M$ numbers on a single line to the standard output.

## Example

### Input
```
4 2
15 2 8 7
```

### Output
```
2 7
```
