# Sequence

## Description
Gosho bothered Mimi for a long time to give him her phone number. Finally, she got fed up with him and decided to give him her phone number, but in a complicated way, of course. She gave him a sequence of $N$ numbers. In the sequence, she hid her phone number as two numbers that are mentioned exactly once. All other numbers are mentioned twice somewhere in the sequence. And because Gosho gets sick when he sees more than 3 digits together, you have to help him with Mimi's task, because if he succeeds with Mimi, he has promised you a banitsa!

## Input
The first line of the input contains a positive integer $N$.
Each of the next $N$ lines contains a corresponding integer.

## Output
Output on a single line the two numbers, separated by a space, in ascending order.

## Constraints

* All other numbers are no larger than $10^{18}$.
