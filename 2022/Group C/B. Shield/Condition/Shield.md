# Shield

## Description
A knight's shield can be made from two triangular metal plates by joining them along one of their sides and fastening them in that position. To make the shield more durable, the two triangles should be fastened so that the perimeter of the resulting shield is as small as possible. Write a program that finds the minimum perimeter that the new shield can have.

## Input
On the first line of the standard input, three integers $a1, b1$ and $c1$ are given – the lengths of the sides of the first triangular metal plate.
On the second line, three integers $a2, b2$ and $c2$ are given – the lengths of the sides of the second triangular metal plate.
The numbers are separated by a single space.

## Output
On a single line of the standard output, the program should output one integer – the minimum perimeter of the shield that can be made from the two triangular metal plates as specified.

## Constraints
* $1 \le a1, b1, c1, a2, b2, c2 \le 1000000000$
