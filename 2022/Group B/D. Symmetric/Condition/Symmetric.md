# Symmetric

## Description
Write a program that finds the count of integers from 1 to $N$ that are symmetric. Symmetric numbers are those that read the same from left to right and from right to left. For example, the number 378873 is symmetric.

## Input
The first line of the standard input contains a single integer $N$.

## Output
On the first line of the standard output, the program should output a single integer representing the count of symmetric numbers found.

## Constraints
* $1 \le N \le 10^{18}$

## Example

### Input
```
25
```

### Output
```
11
```
