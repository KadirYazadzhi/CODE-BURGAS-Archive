# The Diligent Cleaner

## Description
Little Bilyan is still a student, but he is already very enterprising. He really wants to buy a new gaming console, but instead of relying on Santa Claus, he prefers to earn the necessary amount with honest work.

When he went to the village, Bilyan went around the neighbors and asked them how much they would pay him to help them with the harvest. He gathered so many requests that he could choose which ones to accept and which not, to optimize his work.

Bilyan estimated that for the two weekend days he is in the village, he will be able to dedicate a total of 20 hours to his agricultural project. Help him calculate the maximum amount he can earn from his endeavor without exceeding 20 working hours.

## Input
The first line contains the number $N$ ($1 \le N \le 100$) - the number of requests Bilyan has collected.
Each of the following $N$ lines defines a request by a pair of integers $H$ and $M$, separated by a space. $H$ ($1 \le H \le 20$) is the number of hours required to complete the task. $M$ ($1 \le M \le 1000$) is the amount he will receive for the completed work.

## Output
The program should output an integer - the maximum amount Bilyan can earn in 20 hours.
